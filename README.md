Data Analysis using ETL and business intelligence techniques for Data modelling, warehousing and visualization


## Background

There has been tremendous boom in the popularity of a content platform called Youtube in the recent years. The amount of individual contributors, brands and content consumers has multiplied and Youtube has become a big source of income for major organizations, brands and artists. Mining the user activity data from Youtube can help us to seek insights into content preferences based on user choices. Such insightful data analysis is extremely necessary for two major users of this system – the artists (content creators) and the brand managers (Businesses – SMBs or LEs). 


## Project Goal
● To find the top regions for different artists based on viewership and provide interesting actionable insights to them for future events/concerts/shows

● Demographics: Understanding the right demographic and age groups for brands to  target in different categories to maximize campaign ROI

● Analyze current and past data points for various video categories to predict revenue to be generated by top video categories

● Predict views for top music videos for artists for the given time period based on present and past available data

## Data Model & ETL
1. **OLTP** -  7 tables , 6csv + brand(10 brands)

3. **ODS** -  7 oltp tables + video staging ods
    - Trim channel title
    - Calculated field viewer age, Filter based on age
    - Region based on viewer location

3. **Data Warehouse** -  Star schema, 1 fact table, 6 dimension tables

## Steps for execution


1. **Data collection** - Collected data from external sources in the form of CSVs
2. **Data Modelling** - Created schemas for OLTP and ODS databases using Erwin data modeller
3. **Data ETL** -  Performed transformations in the staging ODS database and committed changes to the warehouse with 1 fact & 6 dimension tables
4. **Data Analysis** - Performed descriptive and predictive analysis on the data to generate insights
5. **Data Visualization & Reporting** - Visualized interesting findings in Tableau


## Tableau Analysis
The Insights are split into Audience and Demographic based on predictive and descriptive Analysis
I. **Audience Analysis**  
   ● Descriptive Analysis
      - Geo spacial map of viewership with respect to artist (filter on artist)
      - Treemap of region wise average number of views of artists  

   ● Predictive Analysis
      - Analysis of views/engagement of audience in a particular video for the coming week

## Insights
1. In the first visual, analyzed the audience of each artist in the database to see the popularity of any artist in each region. Used map object which describes the viewership of the artist in the regions. The viewership is color coded i.e. the darker the color of the region higher is the viewership of that artist in that region. 
2. The same is shown below in a Heat map where we can see the region and the average views of the artist in that region. 
3. The third chart is the predictive analysis of views or engagement of audience in a particular video. This shows the projected number of views of a particular 
video in the coming week
4. Audience analysis helps the artists deliver better content, plan their tours or concerts, gain better returns in terms of popularity and revenue and know exactly which part of the audience needs to be targeted


     
II. **Demographic Analysis**  
   ● Descriptive Analysis
      - Most viewed/liked artists  (filter on views or likes)
      - Popularity of a category in every age group
  
   ● Predictive Analysis
      - Analysis of revenue change with respect to categories for a change in the price per view.

## Insights
1. The first visual shows the most liked and viewed videos. It shows the 
top 10 videos viewed by the audience all around the globe.
2. The second visual shows the popular categories among viewer age groups. This shows how many viewers of a 
certain age group are watching videos of the particular category. This gives brand managers an idea about which videos to put their ads on so as to target a particular age group.
3. A similar visualization at the bottom right shows how the viewership varies with each age group for a particular category.
4. And lastly, we build a predictive 
visualization to see how the revenue changes with respect to categories for a change in the 
price per view. This dashboard will help the brands to place advertisements on videos 
strategically by gaining demographic analysis of user base and their preferences in terms of 
languages, categories, culture, etc. to target a specific part of the audience accordingly.
